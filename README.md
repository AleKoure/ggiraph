[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davidgohel/ggiraph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davidgohel/ggiraph)


# ggiraph

> Make 'ggplot' Graphics Interactive
    
# Installation 

You will need the latest ggplot2 version and the latest version of 
rvg.


    install.packages("ggplot2")
    install.packages("rvg")
    devtools::install_github('davidgohel/ggiraph')

# Notes

The project is in development and is highly dependent of the new extension mechanism 
of `ggplot2`. `ggiraph` is using `rvg` that should also evolve and been improved soon.
So patience...
